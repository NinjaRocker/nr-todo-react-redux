# Reducers
Actions describe the fact that something happened, but don’t specify how the application’s state changes in response. This is the job of a reducer.

Actions用来描述某些事情的发生，但是并不标明应用中state相应的变化。标明此变化是reducer的工作。

## Designing the State Shape

In Redux, all application state is stored as a single object. It’s a good idea to think of its shape before writing any code. What’s the minimal representation of your app’s state as an object?

在Redux中，应用中的所有state都从在同一个object中。着手写代码之前，最好是能先研究一下state如何组织。那么问题来了，你的应用可以用什么样最优的状态结构来表示呢？

For our todo app, we want to store two different things:

* The currently selected visibility filter;
* The actual list of todos.

You’ll often find that you need to store some data, as well as some UI state, in the state tree. This is fine, but try to keep the data separate from the UI state.

以后你会经常发现你需要存一些数据，也需要存一些UI状态。已经要尽量把数据和UI状态分开来存。

```JavaScript
{
  visibilityFilter: 'SHOW_ALL',
  todos: [
    {
      text: 'Consider using Redux',
      completed: true,
    },
    {
      text: 'Keep all state in a single tree',
      completed: false
    }
  ]
}
```

Note on Relationships

In a more complex app, you’re going to want different entities to reference each other. We suggest that you keep your state as normalized as possible, without any nesting. Keep every entity in an object stored with an ID as a key, and use IDs to reference it from other entities, or lists. Think of the app’s state as a database. This approach is described in normalizr's documentation in detail. For example, keeping todosById: { id -> todo } and todos: array<id> inside the state would be a better idea in a real app, but we’re keeping the example simple.

## Handling Actions

Now that we’ve decided what our state object looks like, we’re ready to write a reducer for it. The reducer is a pure function that takes the previous state and an action, and returns the next state.

定好state的结构之后，我们就可以开始写reducer了。Reducer必须是纯函数，这个函数传入状态和action，然后返回新的状态。

```JavaScript
(previousState, action) => newState
```

It’s called a reducer because it’s the type of function you would pass to Array.prototype.reduce(reducer, ?initialValue). It’s very important that the reducer stays pure. Things you should never do inside a reducer:

之所以称之为reducer，是因为这个function要传递给Array.prototype.reduce(reducer, ?initialValue). Reducer的定义必须是纯函数。永远不要在reducer里干这些：

* Mutate its arguments;
* Perform side effects like API calls and routing transitions;
* Calling non-pure functions, e.g. Date.now() or Math.random().

* 修改它的参数；
* 执行有副作用的操作，比如调用API和跳转；
* 调用其他不是纯函数的函数，比如Date.now()或者Math.random().

We’ll explore how to perform side effects in the advanced walkthrough. For now, just remember that the reducer must be pure. Given the same arguments, it should calculate the next state and return it. No surprises. No side effects. No API calls. No mutations. Just a calculation.

后续的高级课程中，我们再讨论如何执行有副作用的方法。就目前而言，你只要记住reducer必须是纯函数。传入值不改变，结果就不会改变。

With this out of the way, let’s start writing our reducer by gradually teaching it to understand the actions we defined earlier.

有了这些思想准备，我们就开始根据之前定义的actions来写reducer吧。

We’ll start by specifying the initial state. Redux will call our reducer with an undefined state for the first time. This is our chance to return the initial state of our app:

首先，我们来定义初始化状态。Redux第一次调用reducer时，会传入undefined作为state。这时我们要返回我们应用的初始化状态：

```JavaScript
import { VisibilityFilters } from './actions'

const initialState = {
  visibilityFilter: VisibilityFilters.SHOW_ALL,
  todos: []
}

function todoApp(state, action) {
  if (typeof state === 'undefined') {
    return initialState
  }

  // For now, don’t handle any actions
  // and just return the state given to us.
  return state
}
```

One neat trick is to use the ES6 default arguments syntax to write this in a more compact way:

用上ES6的语法，就可以缩写成以下这种更简洁的方式：

```JavaScript
function todoApp(state = initialState, action) {
  // For now, don’t handle any actions
  // and just return the state given to us.
  return state
}
```

Now let’s handle SET_VISIBILITY_FILTER. All it needs to do is to change visibilityFilter on the state. Easy:

现在来处理SET_VISIBILITY_FILTER. 它只需要修改state上的visibilityFilter就行了。简单：

```JavaScript
function todoApp(state = initialState, action) {
  switch (action.type) {
    case SET_VISIBILITY_FILTER:
      return Object.assign({}, state, {
        visibilityFilter: action.filter
      })
    default:
      return state
  }
}
```

Note that: 这里要注意了：

1. We don’t mutate the state. We create a copy with Object.assign(). Object.assign(state, { visibilityFilter: action.filter }) is also wrong: it will mutate the first argument. You must supply an empty object as the first parameter. You can also enable the object spread operator proposal to write { ...state, ...newState } instead.
2. We return the previous state in the default case. It’s important to return the previous state for any unknown action.

1. 不要改变state。用Object.assign()方法创建一个原state的复本。Object.assign(state, {visibilityFilter: action.filter})也是错的：这样会把{visibilityFilter: action.filter}并入原state中，就改变了原有的state。所以你需要像示例中那样，提供一个空的对象作为第一个参数。当然，你也可以使用object spread operator，写成 {...state, ...newState} 的样子。

Note on Object.assign 关于Object.assign

Object.assign() is a part of ES6, but is not implemented by most browsers yet. You’ll need to either use a polyfill, a Babel plugin, or a helper from another library.

Object.assign()其实是ES6的语法，不过目前的浏览器都还不支持。因此你需要使用polyfill、一个Babel的插件，或者某个库的方法。

Note on switch and Boilerplate

The switch statement is not the real boilerplate. The real boilerplate of Flux is conceptual: the need to emit an update, the need to register the Store with a Dispatcher, the need for the Store to be an object (and the complications that arise when you want a universal app). Redux solves these problems by using pure reducers instead of event emitters.

It’s unfortunate that many still choose a framework based on whether it uses switch statements in the documentation. If you don’t like switch, you can use a custom createReducer function that accepts a handler map, as shown in “reducing boilerplate”.

## Handling More Actions

We have two more actions to handle! Let’s extend our reducer to handle ADD_TODO.

我靠，还有两个actions要处理！那就来继续扩展reducer来支持ADD_TODO吧。

```JavaScript
function todoApp(state = initialState, action) {
  switch (action.type) {
    case SET_VISIBILITY_FILTER:
      return Object.assign({}, state, {
        visibilityFilter: action.filter
      })
    case ADD_TODO:
      return Object.assign({}, state, {
        todos: [
          ...state.todos,
          {
            text: action.text,
            completed: false
          }
        ]
      })    
    default:
      return state
  }
}
```

Just like before, we never write directly to state or its fields, and instead we return new objects. The new todos is equal to the old todos concatenated with a single new item at the end. The fresh todo was constructed using the data from the action.

老规矩，不要直接修改state或者它的field(域、属性)，而是要创建新的object. 新的todos就是在旧的todos末尾增加一条，增加的这条数据来自于action。

Finally, the implementation of the COMPLETE_TODO handler shouldn’t come as a complete surprise:

恩，这样的话COMPLETE_TODO的接盘侠就好理解了：

```JavaScript
case COMPLETE_TODO:
  return Object.assign({}, state, {
    todos: [
      ...state.todos.slice(0, action.index),
      Object.assign({}, state.todos[action.index], {
        completed: true
      }),
      ...state.todos.slice(action.index + 1)
    ]
  })
```
Because we want to update a specific item in the array without resorting to mutations, we have to slice it before and after the item. If you find yourself often writing such operations, it’s a good idea to use a helper like react-addons-update, updeep, or even a library like Immutable that has native support for deep updates. Just remember to never assign to anything inside the state unless you clone it first.

根据不改变原有state的原则，我们用slice方法把todos从要修改的那个todo前后切开，改成新的，再拼接成一个新的todos（真特么绕）。你要是写的满世界都是这种表达式的话，就考虑写了helper方法吧，比如叫react-addons-update, updeep 或者用Immutable这种有类似功能的库。反正你要记住，永远不要修改state，先复制再改。

## Splitting Reducers

Here is our code so far. It is rather verbose:

```JavaScript
function todoApp(state = initialState, action) {
  switch (action.type) {
    case SET_VISIBILITY_FILTER:
      return Object.assign({}, state, {
        visibilityFilter: action.filter
      })
    case ADD_TODO:
      return Object.assign({}, state, {
        todos: [
          ...state.todos,
          {
            text: action.text,
            completed: false
          }
        ]
      })
    case COMPLETE_TODO:
      return Object.assign({}, state, {
        todos: [
          ...state.todos.slice(0, action.index),
          Object.assign({}, state.todos[action.index], {
            completed: true
          }),
          ...state.todos.slice(action.index + 1)
        ]
      })
    default:
      return state
  }
}
```

Is there a way to make it easier to comprehend? It seems like todos and visibilityFilter are updated completely independently. Sometimes state fields depend on one another and more consideration is required, but in our case we can easily split updating todos into a separate function:

有木有什么办法把代码写的更直观一点？目测todos和visibilityFilter的更新没什么交集。有时候state的域之间会有一些依赖关系，因而需要更加慎重处理，不过按照我们现在的例子，显然我们可以把todos的更新分出来写成一个单独的函数：

```JavaScript
function todos(state = [], action) {
  switch (action.type) {
    case ADD_TODO:
      return [
        ...state,
        {
          text: action.text,
          completed: false
        }
      ]
    case COMPLETE_TODO:
      return [
        ...state.slice(0, action.index),
        Object.assign({}, state[action.index], {
          completed: true
        }),
        ...state.slice(action.index + 1)
      ]
    default:
      return state
  }
}

function todoApp(state = initialState, action) {
  switch (action.type) {
    case SET_VISIBILITY_FILTER:
      return Object.assign({}, state, {
        visibilityFilter: action.filter
      })
    case ADD_TODO:
    case COMPLETE_TODO:
      return Object.assign({}, state, {
        todos: todos(state.todos, action)
      })
    default:
      return state
  }
}
```

Note that todos also accepts state—but it’s an array! Now todoApp just gives it the slice of the state to manage, and todos knows how to update just that slice. ***This is called reducer composition, and it’s the fundamental pattern of building Redux apps.***

注意，我们的todos方法看着是接受state的，不过这个state必须是array！todoApp方法只是把state的一部分交给todos来处理，todos也就只能处理这一块而已。 ***介个灰常重要，在Redux中，这样的开发模式叫做reducer composition。***

Let’s explore reducer composition more. Can we also extract a reducer managing just visibilityFilter? We can:

继续探索reducer composition. 我们也可以把visibilityFilter的管理抽出来，写成一个函数（我才不告诉你这么简单的抽出来就是为了给你举个栗子）：

```JavaScript
function visibilityFilter(state = SHOW_ALL, action) { // 看到我的默认值没
  switch (action.type) {
  case SET_VISIBILITY_FILTER:
    return action.filter
  default:
    return state
  }
}
```

Now we can rewrite the main reducer as a function that calls the reducers managing parts of the state, and combines them into a single object. It also doesn’t need to know the complete initial state anymore. It’s enough that the child reducers return their initial state when given undefined at first.

重构一下，现在主reducer就是个分工的方法，它负责把state分给不同的责任块儿，并把他们包到一个对象中去。

```JavaScript
function todos(state = [], action) {
  switch (action.type) {
    case ADD_TODO:
      return [
        ...state,
        {
          text: action.text,
          completed: false
        }
      ]
    case COMPLETE_TODO:
      return [
        ...state.slice(0, action.index),
        Object.assign({}, state[action.index], {
          completed: true
        }),
        ...state.slice(action.index + 1)
      ]
    default:
      return state
  }
}

function visibilityFilter(state = SHOW_ALL, action) {
  switch (action.type) {
    case SET_VISIBILITY_FILTER:
      return action.filter
    default:
      return state
  }
}

function todoApp(state = {}, action) {
  return {
    visibilityFilter: visibilityFilter(state.visibilityFilter, action),
    todos: todos(state.todos, action)
  }
}
```

***Note that each of these reducers is managing its own part of the global state. The state parameter is different for every reducer, and corresponds to the part of the state it manages.***

***你看，每一个reducer处理全部state的一块。每个reducer负责的块不同，因此也传入不同的state。***

This is already looking good! When the app is larger, we can split the reducers into separate files and keep them completely independent and managing different data domains.

这段代码看着有那么个样子了！等app庞大起来之后，我们可以把reducers分到不同的文件中，相互独立不影响，分别处理数据的不同区域。

Finally, Redux provides a utility called combineReducers() that does the same boilerplate logic that the todoApp above currently does. With its help, we can rewrite todoApp like this:

Redux提供一个工具方法叫combineReducers()可以把所有的reducer组到一起（这个坑早就给你挖好了）。然后我们重写一下todoApp就成了这样：

```JavaScript
import { combineReducers } from 'redux'

const todoApp = combineReducers({
  visibilityFilter,
  todos
})

export default todoApp
```

Note that this is completely equivalent to:

```JavaScript
export default function todoApp(state = {}, action) {
  return {
    visibilityFilter: visibilityFilter(state.visibilityFilter, action),
    todos: todos(state.todos, action)
  }
}
```

You could also give them different keys, or call functions differently. These two ways to write a combined reducer are completely equivalent:

键值也是可以指定的。这两种写法是一个意思：

```JavaScript
const reducer = combineReducers({
  a: doSomethingWithA,
  b: processB,
  c: c
})
```

```JavaScript
function reducer(state, action) {
  return {
    a: doSomethingWithA(state.a, action),
    b: processB(state.b, action),
    c: c(state.c, action)
  }
}
```

All combineReducers() does is generate a function that calls your reducers ***with the slices of state selected according to their keys,*** and combining their results into a single object again. It’s not magic.

combineReducers()的工作原理是根据键值拿着对应的state部分去调用对应的reducer，最后再把结构合并成一个object。其实也没啥神奇的。

Note for ES6 Savvy Users

Because combineReducers expects an object, we can put all top-level reducers into a separate file, export each reducer function, and use import * as reducers to get them as an object with their names as the keys:

毕竟combineReducers要传入一个对象，你可以把所有reducers放在单独的一个文件中，用import * as reducers的语法把所有export出来的reducers作为一个对象引入，这个对象中就是名字作键值，方法作值：

```JavaScript
import { combineReducers } from 'redux'
import * as reducers from './reducers'

const todoApp = combineReducers(reducers)
```

Because import * is still new syntax, we don’t use it anymore in the documentation to avoid confusion, but you may encounter it in some community examples.

不过毕竟import * 是一个新语法，我们文档里就不再用它了，以免造成理解上的困惑。

## Next Steps

Next, we’ll explore how to create a Redux store that holds the state and takes care of calling your reducer when you dispatch an action.

接下来，我们研究如何创建Redux store，store如何保存state，以及如何你dispatch一个action的时候如何调用reducer。
