# Data Flow
Redux architecture revolves around a ***strict unidirectional data flow.***

Redux的结构是***严格的单向数据流***。

This means that all data in an application follows the same lifecycle pattern, making the logic of your app more predictable and easier to understand. It also encourages data normalization, so that you don't end up with multiple, independent copies of the same data that are unaware of one another.

也就是说，应用中所有的数据都有相同的生命周期模式，使得应用的逻辑更易懂，可控。这样数据也更规范。（啥啥啥，都是啥！）

If you're still not convinced, read Motivation and The Case for Flux for a compelling argument in favor of unidirectional data flow. Although Redux is not exactly Flux, it shares the same key benefits.

你若还不信，自挂东南枝。(ノ｀Д)ノ

The data lifecycle in any Redux app follows these 4 steps:

Redux应用中数据的生命周期分以下4步：

### 1. You call store.dispatch(action).

### 第一步：调用store.dispatch(action)。

An action is a plain object describing what happened. For example:

action是一个平凡的object对所发生的事情的客观描述。

```JavaScript
 { type: 'LIKE_ARTICLE', articleId: 42 }
 { type: 'FETCH_USER_SUCCESS', response: { id: 3, name: 'Mary' } }
 { type: 'ADD_TODO', text: 'Read the Redux docs.' }
```

Think of an action as a very brief snippet of news. “Mary liked article 42.” or “‘Read the Redux docs.’ was added to the list of todos.”

你可以把action理解为一条简讯。（不翻，看上面的代码示范）

You can call store.dispatch(action) from anywhere in your app, including components and XHR callbacks, or even at scheduled intervals.

store.dispatch(action)可以在任何地方被调用，包括但不限于component里，XHR回调里，甚至定制的intervals里。

### 2. The Redux store calls the reducer function you gave it.

### 第二步：Redux的store会调用你提供的reducer方法。

The store will pass two arguments to the reducer: the current state tree and the action. For example, in the todo app, the root reducer might receive something like this:

store会给reducer传两个参数：当前的state树和dispatch的action。

```JavaScript
 // The current application state (list of todos and chosen filter)
 let previousState = {
   visibleTodoFilter: 'SHOW_ALL',
   todos: [
     {
       text: 'Read the docs.',
       complete: false
     }
   ]
 }

 // The action being performed (adding a todo)
 let action = {
   type: 'ADD_TODO',
   text: 'Understand the flow.'
 }

 // Your reducer returns the next application state
 let nextState = todoApp(previousState, action)
```

Note that a reducer is a pure function. It only computes the next state. It should be completely predictable: calling it with the same inputs many times should produce the same outputs. It shouldn’t perform any side effects like API calls or router transitions. These should happen before an action is dispatched.

注意了啊，reducer是纯函数。它只负责计算结果state，所以它必须是可预测的：同样的参数必然返回同样的结果。

### 3. The root reducer may combine the output of multiple reducers into a single state tree.

### 第三步：终极reducer负责把多个reducers返回的结果合并到单一一个state树中。

How you structure the root reducer is completely up to you. Redux ships with a combineReducers() helper function, useful for “splitting” the root reducer into separate functions that each manage one branch of the state tree.

如何组织终极reducer你可以任意发挥。Redux自带的combineReducers()方法可以把终极reducer分成多个reducer，分别负责state树的不同枝。

Here’s how combineReducers() works. Let’s say you have two reducers, one for a list of todos, and another for the currently selected filter setting:

```JavaScript
 function todos(state = [], action) {
   // Somehow calculate it...
   return nextState
 }

 function visibleTodoFilter(state = 'SHOW_ALL', action) {
   // Somehow calculate it...
   return nextState
 }

 let todoApp = combineReducers({
   todos,
   visibleTodoFilter
 })
```

When you emit an action, todoApp returned by combineReducers will call both reducers:

```JavaScript
 let nextTodos = todos(state.todos, action)
 let nextVisibleTodoFilter = visibleTodoFilter(state.visibleTodoFilter, action)
```

It will then combine both sets of results into a single state tree:

```JavaScript
 return {
   todos: nextTodos,
   visibleTodoFilter: nextVisibleTodoFilter
 }
```

While combineReducers() is a handy helper utility, you don’t have to use it; feel free to write your own root reducer!

虽然combineReducers()很好用，你也不是非用它不可，也可以自己造轮子嘛。

### 4. The Redux store saves the complete state tree returned by the root reducer.

## 第四步：Redux store保存由root reducer返回的完整state树。

This new tree is now the next state of your app! Every listener registered with store.subscribe(listener) will now be invoked; listeners may call store.getState() to get the current state.

新的state树就是你应用的新state了。所有通过store.subscribe(listener)注册过的监听器都会被调用；监听器也可以主动调用store.getState()获取当前state。

Now, the UI can be updated to reflect the new state. If you use bindings like React Redux, this is the point at which component.setState(newState) is called.

现在，界面可以反映最新的state了。如果你用React Redux的话，这个时候就该调用component.setState(newState)了。

## Next Steps

Now that you know how Redux works, let’s connect it to a React app.

学完Redux的工作原理，我们可以搞个React应用玩玩了。
